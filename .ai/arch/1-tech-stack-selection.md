# ADR-1: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The YouPass IELTS Training Platform requires a modern, scalable, and maintainable technology stack that can support rich interactive features, user authentication, content management, and progress tracking.

## Decision
We have decided to use the following technology stack:

### Backend
- **Node.js with Express**: Provides a lightweight, flexible framework for building the API
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database that offers flexibility for evolving data models
- **Passport.js**: Authentication middleware with support for various strategies
- **JWT**: Secure, stateless authentication mechanism
- **AWS S3**: Cloud storage for course materials and user submissions

### Frontend
- **React.js with TypeScript**: Offers component-based architecture with type safety
- **Redux**: Centralized state management for complex application state
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **Chart.js**: Lightweight library for data visualization
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for API requests

## Rationale
- **JavaScript Ecosystem**: Using JavaScript/TypeScript for both frontend and backend reduces context switching and allows for code sharing.
- **React and Redux**: Industry-standard libraries with excellent community support and documentation.
- **MongoDB**: Offers flexibility for evolving data models compared to SQL databases, which is valuable for an educational platform with diverse content types.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety to prevent common errors and improve developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides rapid UI development capabilities with consistent design.
- **AWS S3**: Reliable, scalable cloud storage solution for various media files.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Faster development with a unified JavaScript ecosystem
- Strong typing with TypeScript reduces runtime errors
- Flexible data model with MongoDB
- Scalable architecture that can grow with user base
- Good developer experience and tooling

### Negative
- MongoDB requires careful schema design to avoid performance issues
- Redux adds boilerplate code for simple state changes
- Team needs to be proficient in both React and Node.js ecosystems
- AWS S3 introduces cloud dependency and potential costs

## Alternatives Considered
- **MERN vs MEAN Stack**: Angular was considered but React was chosen for its flexibility and lighter weight.
- **SQL vs NoSQL**: PostgreSQL was considered but MongoDB was chosen for schema flexibility.
- **Vue vs React**: Vue was considered but React was chosen for its larger ecosystem and TypeScript integration.
- **Firebase vs Custom Backend**: A custom backend was chosen for more control over business logic and data.
