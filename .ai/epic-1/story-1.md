# Story 1: User Authentication System

## Description
Implement a secure authentication system that allows users to register, log in, manage their profiles, and reset passwords.

## Business Value
The authentication system is the foundation of the platform, enabling personalized experiences, progress tracking, and access control to premium content.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can register with email and password
- Users can authenticate with Google OAuth
- Users can log in securely with credentials
- Users can view and update their profile information
- Users can request and complete password reset
- Backend validates user inputs and provides meaningful error messages
- Authentication state persists across browser sessions
- JWT tokens expire and are refreshed appropriately
- Protected routes require authentication

## Dependencies
- MongoDB database setup
- AWS S3 for profile pictures
- Email service for password reset

## Technical Approach
### Backend (Express)
1. Create User model with Mongoose
2. Implement local authentication strategy with Passport.js
3. Implement Google OAuth strategy
4. Create JWT token generation and validation
5. Develop user profile CRUD operations
6. Implement password reset flow
7. Add input validation middleware

### Frontend (React)
1. Create registration form with validation
2. Build login page with both email and Google options
3. Implement protected route component
4. Create profile management page
5. Add password reset request and confirmation pages
6. Implement Redux store for authentication state
7. Add token refresh mechanism
